          This Privacy Policy explains how iTap World (“iTap,” “we,” or “us”)
          collects, uses, and discloses information about you. This Privacy
          Policy applies when you use our websites, mobile applications, and

        <p className="mb-5">
          We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
          changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this
          policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice
          (such as adding a statement to our website or providing you with a
          notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy
          regularly to stay informed about our information practices and the
          choices available to you.

          out a form, submit or post content through our Services, purchase a
          membership, communicate with us via third-party platforms, request

          including your avatar image, photos, posts, responses, and series
          published by you, and any other information you choose to provide.

        <p className="mb-5">
          We do not collect payment information through our Services. We rely on
          third parties to process payments in connection with our Services. Any
          information you provide to facilitate such a payment is subject to the
          third-party payment processor’s privacy policy, and we encourage you
          to review this policy before you provide any information to the
          payment processor.

            We use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to
            collect information about you. Cookies are small data files stored

            Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our
            Services are popular, and count visits. Web beacons (also known as

            our Services and in our emails to help deliver cookies, count
            visits, and understand usage. We also work with third party
            analytics providers who use cookies, web beacons, device
            identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about
            your use of our Services and other websites and applications,

            other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of
            certain content, deliver content targeted to your interests on our
            Services, and better understand your online activity. For more

          Information We Collect from Other Sources
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          We obtain information from third-party sources. For example, we may
          collect information about you from social networks, accounting
          services providers and data analytics providers. Additionally, if you
          create or log into your iTap account through a third-party platform
          (such as Apple, Facebook, Google, or Twitter), we will have access to
          certain information from that platform, such as your name, lists of
          friends or followers, birthday, and profile picture, in accordance
          with the authorization procedures determined by such platform.

        <ul>
          <li className="mb-3 ml-3">
            We share personal information with other users of the Services. For
            example, if you use our Services to publish content, post comments
            or send private notes, certain information about you will be visible
            to others, such as your name, photo, bio, other account information
            you may provide, and information about your activities on our
            Services.

            We share personal information with vendors, service providers, and
            consultants that need access to personal information in order to
            perform services for us, such as companies that assist us with web
            hosting, storage, and other infrastructure, analytics, payment
            processing, fraud prevention and security, customer service,
            communications, and marketing.

          <li className="mb-3 ml-3">
            We may disclose personal information if we believe that disclosure
            is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal
            process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet
            national security or law enforcement requirements. If we are going
            to disclose your personal information in response to legal process,
            we will give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by
            seeking court intervention), unless we are prohibited by law or
            believe doing so may endanger others or cause illegal conduct. We
            will object to legal requests for information about users of our
            Services that we believe are improper.

          <li className="mb-3 ml-3">
            We may share personal information if we believe that your actions
            are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, if we believe
            that you have violated the law, or if we believe it is necessary to
            protect the rights, property, and safety of iTap, our users, the
            public, or others.

            We share personal information with our lawyers and other
            professional advisors where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise
            protect and manage our business interests.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-3 ml-3">
            We may share personal information in connection with, or during

            financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by
            another company.

          </li>
          <li className="mb-3 ml-3">
            We share personal information with your consent or at your

        <p className="mb-5 font-bold">THIRD-PARTY EMBEDS</p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          iTap does not host some of the content displayed on our Services.
          Users have the ability to post content that is actually hosted by a
          third party, but is embedded in our pages (an “Embed”). When you
          interact with an Embed, it can send information about your interaction
          to the hosting third party just as if you were visiting the third
          party’s site directly. For example, when you load a iTap post page
          with a YouTube video Embed and watch the video, YouTube receives
          information about your activity, such as your IP address and how much
          of the video you watch. iTap does not control what information third
          parties collect through Embeds or what they do with the information.
          This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through
          Embeds. The privacy policy belonging to the third party hosting the
          Embed applies to any information the Embed collects, and we recommend
          you review that policy before interacting with the Embed.

          ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPE

        <p className="mb-5">
          If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United

        <p className="mb-5 font-bold">Legal Basis for Processing</p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          When we process your personal data, we will do so in reliance on the
          following lawful bases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li className="mb-3 ml-3">
            To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g.,
            providing the products and services you requested).
          </li>
          <li className="mb-3 ml-3">
            When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data
            to operate our business or protect our interests (e.g., to provide,
            maintain, and improve our products and services, conduct data
            analytics, and communicate with you).
          </li>
          <li className="mb-3 ml-3">
            To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of
            your consents and track those who have opted out of
            non-administrative communications).
          </li>
          <li className="mb-3 ml-3">
            When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive
            non-administrative communications from us). When consent is the
            legal basis for our processing your personal data, you may withdraw
            such consent at any time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-5 font-bold">Data Retention</p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          We store personal data associated with your account for as long as
          your account remains active. If you close your account, we will delete
          your account data within 14 days. We store other personal data for as
          long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which we originally
          collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to
          meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations.
